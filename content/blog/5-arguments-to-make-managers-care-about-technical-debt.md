  If you think that management wouldn't let you refactor Legacy Code, use these
  5 arguments to convince them

> Management won't let me refactor Legacy Code!

Do you recognize your current situation here? How *frustrating* is that!

As a developer, it's quite common to be confronted with managers who don't seem interested in fixing what's already here. 

New features. Emergency releases. Bug fixes! There's always an excuse to postpone the refactoring of that messy codebase. ðŸ˜­

Even when you explain the merits and benefits of clean code, they still not seem to understand, or care. Focus is always on *cost* and *time* instead of **quality**. And there you are, feeling powerless to address the accumulating technical debt.

> It feels like a lost cause!

> Clients won't pay for the refactoring.

> IT is stuck doing production support for impatient customers.

This is what pushed the good developers to pack up and leave the company. Now it's just like a revolving door, with developers coming in and outâ€¦

## Managers aren't engineers

TK: talk about refactoring and clean code, maybe use the tech debt analogy and that sounds nice. But in the end, there are impatient customers to serve. Also, you're an expert, you're supposed to do good code from the beginning right? 

You need to help management understand **the impact of bad code quality on the business**.

After all, what matters to the company is money. Profitability. Management needs to take the best decisions to reduce cost and increase revenue.

Therefore, you should learn to **speak business language** if you want to make a case for refactoring.

> You don't write clean code for the sake of it. You write clean code because it's more productive.

What you need is a way to express that so management understands and wants that. As a former consultant and Tech Lead, that's something I'm used to do.

So let me give you a helping hand ðŸ˜‰

## 5 arguments you can use with management

### 1) "Refactoring will reduce the volatility in the marginal cost of features"

TK: Jbrains economics of software dev / Speak their language, talk about delivery time and reducing cost by improving quality / Give financial context (how much it cost) / Use manager language, say it's cost effective

### 2) "In the last 3 months, we spent 63% of development budget in fixing quality issues"

TK: List problems to management (new features estimates bigger, bug list grow, good team members leave) / Keep a registry of issues and time required to solve them. Show management a slideshow after a few months / Remind management why the effort is worth it by telling them how much time you loose because of code quality

### 3) "We took technical loans to ship faster. Now we have to pay back some debt if we want to keep our time-to-market low"

TK: Use metaphors (kitchen, buying a fridge, etc.) / Use the credit card analog

### 4) "We can reduce our turnover by investing 10% of our time in our code quality"

TK: How much does it cost to replace a leaving employee

### 5) "Investing 20% of our budget in refactoring could cut our FRT in half with a positive ROI on developers productivity"

TK: Propose a plan to reduce the number of support issues, make it easier for support to handle more issues without the need of development / time spent on helping Support

## But in the end, *they* decide

Right?

TK: also, include refactoring as part of implementing the feature. Refactor as you go. Don't refactor the world. It's not about good. It's about better.
