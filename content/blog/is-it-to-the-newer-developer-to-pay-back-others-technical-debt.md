  Is it the best use of their time when more experienced developers could
  refactor the code in no time?

Proof. "Editing someone else's code doesn't feel as cool as writing something new" / "Full-time engineers do the interesting work" / "As an intern it's natural to get the bitch work nobody else wants" (refactoring legacy code)

Proof. Maybe the developers who wrote the code are still in the company, but they're now working on more exciting projects? "It has taken me so much time to even understand what the original code was doing" / "I think the guy who wrote the code I'm refactoring could get it all done in a day" / "it's taken me a month so far and I'm still not done" "I feel it's not an efficient use of time" / "I feel my skills are not being best utilised" / "I regret to have turned down a lot of opportunities"

Proof. Maybe you think Even after 10y of XP I don't always do interesting stuff. It's part of the job.

Answer: 2 points. 

1, It will become easier, because what's LC => unfamiliar (TK link to other blog post). With experience in working on the codebase, you'll have more context and knowledge to refactor the code. You'll feel more comfortable after 1 year. Coding is not the problem. It's "their whole system you need to get used to". You need to get used to the tools and code they have. You need to learn. You'll have less fear as you get experience. It's work you can do on yourself. You'll enjoy it and it's a valuable skill to master. "Refactoring code is a fantastic learning experience." / "Refactoring code teaches a lot" / "Just be patient" / The work you do know is really important. Even if it doesn't seem like it. / "You'll appreciate it one day" / "It's worth a shot"

2, Ok, but here's a concrete fix you can also try. You're in the best position to document. Do that. Document what you learn. Show that documentation. If you're new to the code, you're in a great position to document it. What's confusing to you? What needs doc? Figure it out and add the docs. You're becoming a domain expert, uncovering the unknowns. Do that and you'll build trust. Engineers and managers will trust your expertise more and more and you'll have a powerful position to be heard. / "Engineers will really appreciate you for it" / "It makes you a domain expert and someone who has authority on that subject" / Learning legacy code is the most valuable thing for the company. Learning to work with other people's code is valuable skillset.
