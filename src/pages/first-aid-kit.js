        <h2>How do you feel about your codebase?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Worried</strong>, because you don't know if you'll break
          anything once you release this change you've been working on for a
          week already.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Exhausted</strong>, because everything is such a tangled mess
          that you spend hours looking through 20 classes nesting and calling
          each other just to figure out what happens when you check or uncheck a
          checkbox.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Confused</strong>, because you're not sure the code you're
          reading is even used.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pissed</strong>, because it takes weeks before you feel safe
          making any changes, and months before you start feeling "at home" in
          the code. Finally, you are tasked to fix a bug on a different part of
          the codebase: the nightmare starts over again.
        </p>
        <h2 class="quote">
          I wish I'd been given more time to refactor this code!
        </h2>
        <p>
          But you have short deadlines. Because the focus is always on cost and
          time. Because users don't care your eyes bleed while reading the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your boss doesn't understand <em>why</em> it takes you longer and
          longer to finish tasks.
        </p>

          <strong>
            You want to refactor. But would you risk the deadline?
          </strong>{" "}
          So you pile up on Technical Debt, looking for a workaround that would
          get the job done while making the code worse.
        </p>
        <p>
          You know Clean Code would be a breeze to work with‚Ä¶ but you don't know
          where to start, and you certainly don't have enough time to get there.

        <p>
          What if you had a catalog of techniques to bring your codebase under
          tests?
        </p>
        <p>
          If you know the moves, you can give your code first aid that will stop
          its hemorrhage. Imagine how proud and relieved you'll feel as you put
          it back into a healthier shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Refactoring would become second nature to you. Your reflexes will make
          you clean up Legacy Code in no time! You'll consistently meet clients'
          expectations and delight your peers.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can start making this codebase a better place ‚Äî the next time you
          touch it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you have short deadlines, trying to refactor the code is a risky
          move‚Ä¶ unless you know <u>exactly</u> what you're doing.
